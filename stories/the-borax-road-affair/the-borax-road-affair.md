## The Borax Road Affair

<br />
<br />
##### The North Gate of Cass Merides

The Tonor&oacute;nos came to the Northern gate of Cass Merides under a flying autumn morning. Strips of gray and white clouds ran down a stiff northwesterly breeze. Above them the sky was blue and deep, stitched with the dark wheeling forms of hawks and vultures.

The picked platoon made a proud show, approaching the Cass which had been their bitter enemy for over a generation. The road wound between slopes and rock outcrops, manned by Merideza sentries and archers. The Tonor&oacute;nos made as if they did not see the armed foemen above. They marched along the hardpack surface with the wiry ease of long practice, hawk-faced men under the floating black bandera with its dun-colored raptor insignia.

Humano officers, in tan and black battle dress and flowing tan headscarves, wore the two ceremonial swords. Sergeants in dress black, and grim slave soldiers in tan uniforms, bore daggers, short swords, and short bows. They sang a short deep-voiced cadence as they marched. Following the marchers came Dun Heitor with a small crew of dignitaries and retainers, riding on the dryland horses that were Cass Tonor&oacute;n&#8217;s particular pride. Heitor rode easily, black headdress flowing in the wind, his rolling shoulders, bristling moustachios, and fierce watchful face the very picture of a Humano warrior of the dry hills.


Corro, Dun of Cass Merides, waiting by the gate, watched his lifelong enemies approach with honest admiration and cold hatred. For a moment Corro closed his eyes, summoning his _imtir_, his internal sensory mnemonic store of memory. Complex, distinctive, disturbing images populated the great chambers of his mind, each the index of some part of Corro&#8217;s lifetime of learning and action. When he opened his eyes again, the mnemonics shifted, some opening and some receding, finding attachment points in his field of vision. He beheld the Tonor&oacute;nos with an overlay of augmented understanding, knowing the names and reputations of men he had scarcely met, knowing scraps and streaks of their histories, reputed moves and styles of fighting. He knew too the names of his comrades they had killed.

Corro knew that many of the Tonor&oacute;nos regarded him with knowledge equally extensive. This was the Humano way. However—and with no arrogance whatsoever—he judged his own _imtir_ to be one of the finest present.

Corro, his lean face closed, watched Heitor with iron eyes. Corro&#8217;s father Greguru was one of the names his internal memory matched against Dun Heitor. Greguru had died fourteen years before, standing against Heitor in single combat. 

Corro had avenged himself on Heitor&apos;s reputation, and he wore the prize of that vengeance at his belt: a dueling sword, longer than the usual Humano short blade, a masterwork of the swordsmith's art. Corro had taken it from Heitor's own scabbard during a Singing duel. Each man cherished a bitter hate and a grudging respect for the other.

When Heitor raised his own eyes of hawk-yellow and their gazes crossed, the clash echoed through Corro&#8217;s _imtir_.

_I must govern myself,_ Corro thought. For the men of Tonor&oacute;n were not there to fight.

<br />

Three forces met before the North Gate in formation, distinct blocks of color in the flaring sun and flying shadow.

The tan and black of Tonor&oacute;n marched to a halt. Facing them to the right was rust and azure: Dun Corro and his retainers. Across the road was green and gold, an ambassadorial delegation from the Furnace, which had arrived the evening before. Their honor guard of thirty burly soldiers stood as guarantors of the peace.

Firix the ambassador, author of that peace, a beautiful woman with striking auburn hair blowing in the morning breeze, her garb glowing fire-green in the morning, stood proudly with her Surveyor Illiar, a tall woman with a perpetually puckered brow. The ambassadorial party was positioned between her soldiers and the gate: pragmatically out of the line of fire should the Furnace troops need to employ those well-tended firearms at their belts.

&#8220;A good morning for peace,&#8221; Trihanj murmured to Corro. She was a second cousin on his father&#8217;s side, and the most prominent of his syndics. A tall, rather thin woman, she wore her dress uniform with poise—but her sword, dagger, short bow, and quiver with the kind of familiar ease that surpasses poise. An extremely likable person. She had attempted to kill Corro twice before acknowledging his superior Potential.

&#8220;A good day indeed,&#8221; he agreed. It was a bright cool morning, the harsh heat of summer having at last given way.

Firix bowed gracefully, and smiled at both Dun Heitor and Dun Corro. &#8220;Be so good as to follow me to the Upper Hall,&#8221; she said to Heitor. Then she turned and walked through the gate. After her the Tonor&oacute;nos proceeded, dipping their bandera to enter; then the Furnace guard, in crisp order; and lastly, their hosts, the leaders of Cass Merides.

<br />
##### The Upper Hall of Cass Merides

The walls were high and the floor somewhat sunken. Lofty clerestory windows let in the morning, which shone on the brilliant white walls, flooding the assembly chamber with clear light. Cool fall breezes drifted in.

By arrangement, the Tonor&oacute;nos were assembled in the south end, the Meridezas to the north. Between them the Furnace soldiers and ambassadorial mission stood in dignified readiness, a physical presence to deter unfortunate mischance.

&#8220;Behold the Furnace thugs,&#8221; Siscozo of Tonor&oacute;n muttered to Dun Heitor. &#8220;They are big men, and strong, and stand in pretty ranks; but not a one of them could stand against either of us with a blade.&#8221;

&#8220;Do not dismiss them,&#8221; Heitor said. &#8220;They are well trained, and their combat marksmanship is most effective. Their guns could kill far too many of us if we were foolish enough to attack them. It would be a great kindness to Cass Merides to do that. This talk is idle.&#8221;

Humanos are well trained to read voices. Siscozo, not for the first time, heard in Heitor&#8217;s speech the overtones of a cold and assured killer. Yet Heitor, despite his ferocity, thought always with deliberate discipline. Siscozo&#8217;s boastful quarrelsomeness impressed the Dun not at all. Which suited Siscozo well: he had invested many hours in making Heitor think him a talented braggart.

The talent, at least, was genuine.

<br />

Firix the Ambassador called the meeting to order. She spoke far more briefly and bluntly than diplomats normally do; but she had spent enough time among the Humanos to know that windy speeches would earn their confidence not at all, and spoke gracefully for their ears.

&#8220;All will have noticed the balance of forces at this meeting. Neither Cass stands to gain by sudden attack, and in the event of hostilities the Furnace can only lose. Although, to be fair,&#8221; she grinned briefly, &#8220;some in the Council may grow tired of my voice and would not weep to hear it silenced&#8230; if matters go badly and I am killed, some of the survivors may wish to claim credit from El Excepcion, for instance. Might be worth some field radios or long guns.&#8221; A brief appreciative stir ran through the Hall. Firix&#8217;s grim humor and false modesty suited the Humano temperament well.

&#8220;The history of this conflict is well known to all present. However, the Furnace&#8217;s interest in amending it has been a matter held in confidence. I shall now explain it in full.&#8221; From the Humanos at both ends of the Hall came a sense of renewed attention. _These people have superb focus,_ she thought. _Speaking to them is easy, but they will notice the slightest slip._ She pitched her voice slightly lower, holding them with her eyes. &#8220;The Furnace, I regret to say, is facing concerns about sustainability.&#8221;

Dead silence. _That was not what they expected to hear. Good. Corro and Heitor have kept the topic to themselves._ &#8220;Raw materials? Metals? The City and its surroundings have been thoroughly picked over&#8230; In time, we may find that our ability to create concentrated-energy products is no longer a paying business proposition. When that happens, we genuinely do not know what will become of us. The Furnace can never be a closed system. For some time now we have been painstakingly recovering and resmelting the filings from our machining processes.&#8221;

Her audience understood. The Humanos were a sword-and-bow culture for reasons similar to her argument. They were very dedicated to being able to craft their own tools, instruments, and weapons. _Successors make their own._

&#8220;In practice, it will be a long time before these materials become too critical. There is, however, one very difficult, very unexpected problem we have to face and deal with.&#8221; Firix leaned forward slighly, gathering them with her eyes.

&#8220;The Furnace will soon lose the ability to fabricate new solar mirrors. Even replacements for our existing furnaces and engines.&#8221;

The sudden buzz of exclamation that swept through the disciplined listeners gladdened her. She had chosen to speak to a large group all at once, and it was working. Humanos were deeply educated—_Great Mother Within, even the_ slaves _are listening!_

&#8220;Mirrors do not seem like such a great matter, do they? Not when compared to the truly difficult things you are willing to buy from us: precision optics, or bearing races, or bandsaw blades, or hardened machine tools, or long guns that can kill at twelve hundred meters? But much to our dismay, much to our embarassment—our humiliation—we neglected a simple fact until too late.

&#8220;The only feasible substrate for our mirrors is borosilicate glass. Our stores of borax are almost gone. And the only natural sources of borax are far to the south, in the Dead Dry.&#8221;

Educated the Humanos might be, but a frisson of superstitious awe rustled through the Hall. The Dead Dry, where no one could live any longer, was in many respects the hell of conscious cultures.

&#8220;The specific region in which borax was dug had an evil name even in Waster times, _before_ the ruin of the climate. Now no one lives within hundreds of kilometers; no one can travel there very well. There is very little water, and a caravan of pack animals could not survive without careful pre-siting of water barrels along a known route. And then there is the problem of actually finding the correct stuff.&#8221; She shrugged. &#8220;The Wasters dug it from open pits with their equipment. That is clearly not an option for us.&#8221;

&#8220;We&#8217;ve been studying this quietly for a dozen years. Everywhere we turned, there was something to block the solution. We had reached the point of despair—until,&#8221; she smiled, &#8220;one of our traders visited Cass Estelo, and went down to the desert, and took a ride on a skitterer.&#8221;

&#8220;Do you seriously think you can take _skitterers_ down thousands of miles to the south, and do anything useful with them when you get there?&#8221; Dina Isme of Merides, herself an accomplished skitterer pilot and a senior syndic, spoke up, her voice pitched to carry through the hall. _These people and their hall meetings,_ Firix thought appreciatively. _As outspoken as the most senior directorate meetings in the Council, but with a much more measured discipline._

&#8220;No, of course not,&#8221; said Firix. &#8220;Personally, I regret that—the romance of a fleet of skitterers cruising down the sands of the Calicar Barran&#8217;, sails aloft in the moonlight? I&#8217;d hang up my ambassadorship to crew that expedition.&#8221; Smiles in the Hall answered her. For a moment she hesitated. _That was a little too revealing&#8230;_ &#8220;No, we considered ways to make that work, but in the end wind power could not be the answer.

&#8220;But the Humano  skitterers showed us the way nonetheless. You have solved, most elegantly, the problems of suspension and wheels for traversing sand and rock and eroded earth. And we, of course, build high-efficiency closed cycle solar steam engines.&#8221; Firix surveyed the now silent Hall.

&#8220;We propose to build ground crawlers, with high self-repair and cargo capacity, carrying great stores of water, food, and tools. We have scouted the routes. We have designed and tested digging equipment.

&#8220;We can mount an expedition, lasting through the fall and winter and returning home by spring, that will bring back enough borax for us to smelt glass for three hundred years.&#8221;

That startled them. Another rustle swept through the Hall.

&#8220;But we need a road for the machines, a broad and well-founded road from our funicular terminus at Eastwall Station, down to the Calicar Barran&#8217;. Ironic, isn&apos;t it, that the worst of the journey will be the short stretch from the mountains down to the desert, here? With the hard topography, the only realistic route runs along the country between Tonor&oacute;n and Merides. Our engineers and workers cannot fulfill such a great work in a land that is the frontier of battle.

&#8220;For the best of reasons, the Furnace desires peace between you. That is why I am here.

&#8220;Nor am I here empty-handed. Enmity between Cass Tonor&oacute;n and Cass Merides is of long standing, and will not vanish because I wave my hand or because I tell you about the Furnace&apos;s mad plan for bringing borax north from the Dead Dry.&#8221;

She spent a slow moment sweeping the crowd with her gaze. _I like these people_. The thought tore her, but she was too old a hand to betray it, even to the hyperacute discernment of Humanos.

&#8220;The Furnace stands ready to provide items of substantial value to Cass Tonor&oacute;n and Cass Merides. This anyone of sense would expect.

&#8220;But of course, this is a matter of honor, not to be amended by mere goods.&#8221; Her gaze traveled to the two Duns, gathering them. &#8220;Every Humano on the front range knows the tale. The great duel between Greguru of Merides and Heitor of Tonor&oacute;n is the matter of many songs. And then, Corro&apos;s brilliant revenge.&#8221; 

Neither Corro nor Heitor moved a muscle. This was the delicate moment. She lapsed subtly into the storytelling style of speech common in the Humano Casas.

&#8220;Corro challenged Heitor to a duel. Heitor and his seconds went to the place appointed, and waited for Corro. Corro, as all know, was late. And then, he was very late. Heitor and his seconds began to scoff, and then to mock outright. At last Heitor, in great good humor, said that Corro was clearly afraid to show himself. &#2018;But perhaps he lurks nearby,&#2019; Heitor told his comrades. And then Heitor, one of the great Singers of the Front Range, began to Sing.

&#8220;Heitor&apos;s seconds were a woman and man of honest thought and temper; and they have both said, of this song, that it was subtle and powerful, cunningly crafted to reach Corro&apos;s _imtir_ with a burden of shame and confusion. Were Corro within earshot at all, it seemed to them, he would be forced out of hiding, either in abject shame and defeat or in reckless fury, easy meat for Dun Heitor&apos;s famous blade.

&#8220;But then, the unexpected thing came to pass.&#8221; The audience knew this story, and they loved hearing it well told. Firix savored the nuances of their attention, responding and building, modulating her tone and letting the words flow shrewdly, a more formidable storyteller in her own right than they would have expected. She saw Heitor looking at her with flat controlled malice as she retold his greatest humiliation. She saw Corro listening with courteous, studious attention, waiting to see what she meant by it.

&#8220;Interwoven with Heitor&apos;s Song came an answer. Corro was indeed present, and seemingly not far off; though neither Heitor nor his seconds could tell exactly where he might be. Corro&apos;s Song echoed mockingly through the trees and around the rocks, answering every verse, every insult and implication, without disclosing himself. Though Heitor strode back and forth as he sang, slipping through the thickets and leaping lightly around the outcroppings, he could not fix Corro&apos;s position. It was, by anyone&apos;s reckoning, one of the more notable duels of Humano Song.

&#8220;Heitor noted Corro's great achievement, and Sang honest praise of it; but then he remarked that, though it showed great skill, it remained a Song of evasion, that Corro's cleverness could not but be thought of as, in the end, an unwillingness—&#8218;though no Humano would call it fear&#8219;—to face Heitor in open combat.

&#8220;So great was the power of Song that Heitor put forth that Corro fell silent for a moment. Then, in a subdued voice that Heitor and his seconds could barely hear at first, came Corro's answer:

_&#8220;In truth, there is much justice in this Singing
Nor can I withhold respect for your deadly skill with sword
Nor can I claim to fear the outcome of open battle
Nor can I Sing so greatly, it seems: your_ imtir, _Sor, is a place of power
As all Humanos must acknowledge
And your voice a fine voice.

Yet dangerous it is to dwell too deeply in your_ imtir 
_Unmindful of the world of rocks and trees, unmindful of the soft footstep
Dangerous to heed your own Singing too well:

If it's your wish to fight me sword to sword I cannot decline
Your Song compels me to stand forth;
Yet in justice I must tell you 
You're going to need another blade.&#8221;_

&#8220;For so it was. Heitor's scabbard was empty; and neither he nor his seconds could well recall when it had been taken, slipped silently from behind a tree, eased from the sheath when Dun Heitor, the great Singer, was distracted by the power of his own great verses.&#8221;

For a breath there was silence, then all of the Humanos in the Upper Hall broke into shouting applause; for it was a great story, and she had told it well. Even Heitor smote his hands together and shouted, giving Firix her due, for he was a very honest man and her skill was manifest. The Furnace troops and officers did not break parade discipline, but in unison shouted "Ho, Ha, Hai!", their military accolade.

When the outcry had died dow, Firix saw Corro still regarding her speculatively. _I could bed that one_, she thought suddenly, but was careful to show no sign of her mild arousal. She beckoned to her Secretary, Gonsevero, who came forth with dignity, bearing a long richly made box of dark wood.

&#8220;I said earlier that this conflict has been a matter of honor,&#8221; Firix said, her clear voice once again echoing through the Hall. &#8220;The Furnace accordingly proposes gifts of honor, to amend this long enmity.&#8221; From the box she withdrew a dueling sword, long and blue, supple as a living thing. There were a few gasps, but mostly the Humanos watched in silent awe: most of them had never seen a Furnace duelling blade in their lives. She had practiced diligently with swords; she was no master, but her arm and wrist had grown strong enough to hold it up in the clear morning light without a tremor. Solemnly she bore the sword to Heitor, and reversed it over her arm, offering the hilt to him.

&#8220;Dun Heitor of Cass Tonor&oacute;n: the Furnace wishes you to accept this gift. Forged in the Redrock Crucible, of a single piece of the finest steel our metallurgists know how to make; fashioned by the master swordsmith Rubena.&#8221; Heitor looked at her in amazement. Rubena was a name known in the FrontRange: her work was legendary, and far beyond anything the greatest Humano swordsmiths could craft. With dignity he bowed, accepted the blade, and accorded Firix a punctilious dueling salute. She smiled and bowed in return. "Carry it to good fortune, Sor.&#8221;

Returning to Gonsevero, she withdrew another sword, twin to the first. &#8220;To you, Dun Corro of Cass Merides, the Furnace offers a different thing. Rather than a gift, we offer you a choice. Will you trade the famous blade at your belt for this sword from the hand of Rubena?&#8221; She looked at him gravely. &#8220;Will you yield the trophy you took from Dun Heitor on the famous occasion I have recounted?&#8221;

Corro matched her with a solemn expression of his own, but behind it Firix could see a moment of frozen indecision. Then it passed, and he drew his own blade, offered it hilt-first over his arm.






<br />
##### The Lower Hall of Cass Merides

On the evening of the same day, Dina Zemena looked with more than a little satisfaction around the great table. Seldom had such a seating of distinguished folk graced the old sunken Hall.

The guests were well distributed. Tonor&oacute;nos, Meridezas, and the Furnace delegates and officers mingled in comfort and fellowship. Their day had been productive and hopeful, and the optimism of the Humano temperament was showing. Besides the diplomatic attendees, a scattering of other guests were seated among them, of varied stations and kinds: the noble and beautiful Carnente of Cass Feredor conversed elegantly with Sor Sergey of Tonor&oacute;n and the Ambassador&#8217;s secretary Gonsevero, a small, punctilious man with swift eyes and voluble hands. Patru the Outwalker, the roaming scholar from the Nofori Tanglewood far to the east, was a prisoner. He had been taken months ago, and appeared to find his captivity light and courteous. Zemena nursed a growing insight that he was in no hurry to leave: Tanglewood Outwalkers, half legendary, had a lifelong calling to travel the world and eventually bring their knowledge back home. _The Tanglewoods are so far from anywhere, out there in the Dry. They are wise to fear the effects of isolation. And here sits this strange man, with his head full of inexhaustable stories and a half dozen languages on his tongue&#8230; what can he think of us, the people who have imprisoned him?_

Patru&#8217;s speech and knowledge and strength of character had won him a respected place among the noblest of Cass Merides; but a prisoner he remained. Behind his chair, waiting with patient vigilance against the wall, stood his jailor Alesa: a Hound, human slavestock bred for reflexes, focus, and wide-spectrum awareness; trained to kill and to slink, assassin and commando.

Zemena looked with regret and something like love at the barren Hound. Proud creature, Alesa, from the greatest of all the bloodlines Zemena had cultivated. More gifted than any of the other Hounds; not beautiful when considered as a human woman, but surpassingly beautiful to the Breedmistress&#8217;s eye. Perfect conformation, reflexes almost inhumanly quick and correct, brilliantly free of flaw, except the one greatest flaw.

How Dun Greguru had scowled when he&#8217;d learned. He had commanded that Alesa be thrown to the Arena until she died or was so badly injured as to be put down. Zemena&#8217;s regret was as bitter as his own—worse, since as Breedmistress she was responsible for all of the breedings in Merides holdings—but she was long accustomed to governing her husband&#8217;s abrupt ferocity. &#8220;No, my dear, I can&#8217;t have that,&#8221; she&#8217;d said. &#8220;The loss is great, but lesser measures must suffice. I have been working with collateral lines, hoping to rescue her traits. But in her own right, she&#8217;ll be a fine bodyguard for the Cass—I won&#8217;t waste her.&#8221;

Greguru had seen the proof of Zemena&#8217;s wisdom before he died. Alesa had saved their son&#8217;s life twice in combat with a special squadron from Cass Rumoro that had attacked while Greguru was away.

After Dun Corro had succeeded his father, Alesa had stopped an assassination attempt by his cousin Trihanj, killing Trihanj&#8217;s two Hounds, and three of her retainers, as she did.

_And here we all sit, she thought. Impetuous Trihanj is now Corro&#8217;s most loyal syndic, and Corro, triumphant in war and intrigue, the exemplar of Humano Potential, sits at the head of the Table—while I, as Breedmistress, review the ladies being paraded for his notice._

She let her _imtir_ become manifest to her thought and perception as she looked around the Hall. The Hall itself grew taller and more beautiful, with strange filmed shadows blowing at its edges like draperies, opening above to a pulsating night sky in whose depths glimmered constellations, starscapes of the imagination that Zemena alone had ever seen. The seated guests and the standing servitors and guards shone in the real light of cressets and lamps, and to Zemena&#8217;s sight they shone in lights cast from no source, that illuminated them as amazing constructs, each person a landscape of metaphor and memory.

The servitors and work slaves exhibited, to Zemena&#8217;s inner eye, little more than the knowledge of their breeding. They had little else of interest about them: competent and placid, human stock bred to less than Humano potential. The Hounds seemed greater of frame, stooped and gaunt, remorseless animals of war and and the chase, moving from terrible stillness to terrible stillness. The Companions were wrapped in auras of allure and sensitivity, their attention palpably bent to discerning the mood and affect of their assigned guests. All seemed to show, if she looked carefully, attenuating throngs of ancestral ghosts trailing out behind: signatures of Zemena&#8217;s prodigious memory for the bloodlines.

The Humanos of Cass Merides, and some of the guests, all had such ghosts, for she was Breedmistress of the Humanos as well as the slaves. Whatever she knew, from written records or from tales of the past, she held in her _imtir_. Her inner gaze dwelt with brief fondness on one of her favorite ghosts: Asturias of Cass Esteza, Carnente&#8217;s maternal great-grandfather. Asturias, dressed in the somber finery of a century ago, lifted his eyes to Zemena and winked, a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. Zemena, pleased and more than a little surprised, would have blushed had her Humano control been less.

_Seduced by a ghost,_ she snorted to herself. The dangers of such entanglements were well understood. She should perhaps spend a few nights with a Companion.

Such of Carnente&#8217;s _imtir_ as Zemena had been able to understand, or guess, floated in the air around her, and seemed good and well-shaped. _We live and walk alone, all of us. We know so little of one another, studying half-guessed fabrications._

_&#8220;Our son,&#8221;_ rumbled Greguru&#8217;s ghost softly at her side. _&#8220;He looks well, doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221;_

Corro sat at ease yet with perfect poise and bearing, just as she&#8217;d seen him in the saddle or the Arena. Here, as master of the Hall and the Cass, his power and worth seemed evident as seldom before. His face was angular and mobile, his glance keen; he spoke well, with grave courtesy, hard-won wisdom, and rueful merriment. He&#8217;d chosen, for the evening, a pearl-gray shirt and trousers of black trimmed in rust and azure piping: _a subtle statement of subtlety_, Zemena thought wryly.

The Ambassador sat with old doctor Garseyo and the Tonor&oacute;no surveyor. She was without question brilliant and formidable, and had this day brought astonishing gifts to the warring Casas; but something about her troubled Zemena.

The counterpart of the brilliantly rational _imtir_ is the _sconsciende_, the hidden undermind, wellspring of luck and fate, of disaster and intuition, of shadows that cannot be dispelled by thought. Zemena knew that for the source of her sense of Firix. She deliberately relaxed the conceptual walls, letting the _sconsciende_ seep into her _imtir_. The result was something of a shock.

When she looked at Firix&#8217;s face, it seemed stretched like a lovely mask over over the unmistakable skull of a puma. _Manolito&#8217;s eyes. What hidden purpose am I seeing in the soul of this woman, this power of the Furnace?_

<br />
##### The Garden Lanes

Dina Zemena and Dun Heitor of Cass Tonor&oacute;n walked in the sunken lanes of the Cass Merides gardens. The prisoner Patru, and his guard Alesa, walked with them. The singleminded Hell Wind had subsided with oncoming evening, but there was still wind enough, buffeting and rustling the trees and riffing the surfaces of the small ponds.

Heitor was by swift turns courteous and grim, upright in posture but with a strange slouching prowl to his walk. Something about him breathed danger, and not simply that Tonor&oacute;n and Merides were often at sword&#8217;s point: it was the man himself.

Zemena smiled a small crooked smile. _I walk in the company of a proven warrior, a deadly enemy of my Cass with a readiness to kill; and with a skillful, dangerous prisoner whose measure I have yet to fully take._ With Alesa present, she knew she had nothing to fear.

&#8220;You smile, Dina.&#8221; Heitor&#8217;s voice was strange: a courteous punctilio with undertones of scowling bloodthirst.

&#8220;Indeed I do, Dun Heitor. The evening pleases me.&#8221;

The Dun smiled a slow smile. &#8220;You enjoy the danger.&#8221;

&#8220;There are many dangers at the moment. I walk with dangerous men, and the weather looks refreshingly adventurous. And the gardens on a windy evening...&#8221;

No food gardens these, but lovely fantasias of flower and leaf and wood in the gathering dimness. The walled paths twisted and wound, rose and fell, exposing exquisitely designed composed views. Small trees lifted boughs that rustled and seethed as the wind took them; nameless flowers nodded.

For Patru, the peace of the moment was slightly marred. Faintly, traveling over the rustle of leaves in the wind, came a thread of sound—a voice singing an odd high keening note. Masculine; indecipherable; and with the intonation he had come to recognize as the Singing that Humanos used to cast thoughts into the _imtir_ of others. He disliked it, recognizing the kind of dueling Song that he had heard on only a few occasions. He listened for the attendant ring and clash of finely-tempered swords. The Humanos, for whom violence was more a way of life, seemed not even to notice it.

&#8220;I love the garden lanes on a windy evening,&#8221; said Zemena.

&#8220;Your gardenmen are skilled,&#8221; Heitor said, although he spoke brusquely.

&#8220;They are indeed to be honored,&#8221; Patru murmured.

&#8220;One does not _honor_ slaves,&#8221; corrected Zemena quietly. &#8220;Honor is the domain of free people.&#8221;

&#8220;I find such beauty all the more impressive, knowing that it was fashioned by slaves,&#8221; said Patru.

Heitor halted, and rounded on Patru abruptly. &#8220;Who are you, Outwalker, to criticize Humano ways?&#8221; he snarled. Zemena, hearing the death-tones suddenly in his voice, stopped in turn, startled. _Walk warily, Patru,_ she thought. _He could kill you so very quickly._

Patru held himself very still for a moment, then relaxed into a strange sort of half-bow with hands spread. &#8220;Please do not mistake my meaning, Dun Heitor,&#8221; he said quietly, with no challenge in his voice—but no quaver either. The wind gentled, and a great silence seemed to lie behind it. No distant dueling Song could now be heard. &#8220;An Outwalker does not challenge the practices or beliefs of the people he walks among. And in all honesty I have found so much to admire among the Humanos&#8230; In many respects you are greater individuals than any I have encountered. This does not blind me to the qualities of your slaves.&#8221;

Dun Heitor, savage fighter of the front range, stood looking full into Patru&#8217;s face for a moment, as if puzzled. Then he relaxed. &#8220;Perhaps there is something in what you say, Sor. Perhaps.&#8221; With a swift lifting of mood he turned and led the party up a wandering path into a coign facing northwest, and the prospect opened awesomely before them.

Evening was closing over the front range, and a huge boil of cloud was lifting over the western ridgeline, a slate gray mass between the fading sky and the hard dark line of the mountains. _As if the Furnace were some ancient coal-fired monstrosity after all,_ thought Zemena. _A remnant of Waster works up there, unsuspected until now._ The last of sunset traced an edge of fire along the tops of the hulking cloud.

&#8220;What weather do you anticipate, Dina?&#8221; Patru spoke courteously, and Zemena noted the contrast between his studious voice and Heitor&#8217;s veiled ferocity.

&#8220;The _katabateco_.&#8221; She gestured at the lifting clouds to the west. &#8220;The Hell Wind will rise again soon, and its passage will pull the colder air down from the mountains. We are already securing against the storm.&#8221; Below, the Merides gardenlands, intensive dryland permaculture, showed as intricate patches of short groves and sunken beds, stands of bamboo and hemp, narrow waterways shining like coins and ribbons on the dark bunched land. Folk were active down there, bringing down windmills and kitemasts, shuttering the long worksheds, gathering and stowing anything that might be blown about.

&#8220;You smile, Sor,&#8221; said Heitor to Patru. His voice, in a swift change of mood, was oddly companionable.

&#8220;I smile at a memory, Dun Heitor. I once watched preparations for a polar storm on the Siberian coast, in a port called Xishia. I was in port there, waiting for a ship bound for Yokomata. I worked at a chandlery—a dealer in fittings and supplies for ships—improving my Siberian and learning to keep the books.&#8221;

&#8220;What have you _not_ done?&#8221; cried Zemena in amusement.

&#8220;I have not escaped my captivity in Cass Merides,&#8221; said Patru gravely. Heitor chuckled, and Zemena smiled crookedly. _I like Heitor_, she realized in mild surprise.

&#8220;Xishia, especially during the times of year when the sun is not hidden,&#8221; Patru said, &#8220;is a mad confusion—a thousand voices shouting and chaffering, hawking wares, the bawling of bullocks and shrieking of seagulls, clanging of gongs on the buoys and in the temples, the rattle and squeal of blocks and ropes on the wharves. Hulls creak and groan when the lifting waves come down the channels, rolling the rafted junks against one another. A place of stinks too, for the city is crude and indifferent in its handling of wastes.&#8221; Patru shook his head. &#8220;a wild and careless folk, but I liked them.

&#8220;All folk of the Polar Sea know how to read storm sign. But no two of them agree on the reading, it seems.&#8221; He smiled wryly. &#8220;Until the signs become obvious&#8230; and then it&#8217;s like an anthill stirred with a stick.&#8221;

For a moment, there was silence. The Zemena asked quietly, &#8220;And what in our preparations made you think of the Siberians?&#8221;

Patru looked down at the purposeful activity below. &#8220;More than anything? It was the contrast. The organized and disciplined work here, so unlike the chaos in Xishia. In all honesty, it made me realize that never in all of my travels have I visited a place so _clean_ as Cass Merides.&#8221;

As if to mock his earnestness, the distant Singing again drifted down the wind. _I wonder if someone will wind up dead over there._

&#8220;Xishia was dirty and noisy, but in justice there&#8217;s another thing... the brawling cities of the Siberian Coast are perhaps the closest a man can come, in this day and age, to understanding the free chaotic allure of the old Waster way of life. We are, after all, the same breed of people as the Wasters, and the instincts and passions that moved them live within us as well.&#8221;

&#8220;_You_ may be of the same breed,&#8221; said Zemena, Breedmistress of Cass Merides. &#8220;We Humanos aspire to something further.&#8221;

&#8220;You offer insult?&#8221; growled Heitor. The killer looked out of his eyes.

Patru bowed. &#8220;Forgive me, I beg you both. I meant no insult to the Humano breeding endeavors.&#8221; _Even if I think them unlikely to bear fruit._ &#8220;I spoke only of the common genetic heritage of humanity.&#8221; He was grateful to note that the rustle of wind had drowned out the distant, unpleasant Singing.

Heitor&#8217;s gaze was dead and direct. After a pause, he inclined his head. &#8220;No offense intended, none need be taken,&#8221; he said curtly.

Then, as if nothing had happened, Heitor resumed his prowling walk, leading the party down a shallow flight of steps with perfect courtesy.


<br />
##### The Watchpost

Dina Zemena stood on a prow of old masonry that jutted from Cass Meridess&#8217;s eastern side. The morning was pale and yellow. The eastern sky smoked with long stacked southbound streamers of dust and sand raised by the Hell Wind: some seventy kilometers, she judged, out on the plain. Nearer at hand, the greatest mass of the gardenlands fell in dark steps.

The wind, chill changeable remnant of the _katabateco_ that had howled through the night, buffeted Zemena and riffled her cloak, sending its hem flapping this way and that as the wind switched.

Zemena enjoyed the wind, had always enjoyed windy mornings, but something tense loomed in her thoughts today. She had watched the review party ride away down the winding lanes of the gardenlands, Corro and Heitor in comfortable proximity, Siscozo and the Tonor&oacute;no scribe escorted by a good dozen soldiers, Sor Won leading a similar detachment of Merideza soldiers and two Hounds. The surveyors from both Casses stood with Illiar of the Furnace, gesturing in learned animation down the intended track of the Borax Road.

She watched them leave the gardenlands, small with distance, and wind down through the barren hills and shallow ridges until they were lost to view.

There was a step behind her, and she turned to see Firix, accompanied by her secretary Gonsevero. Firix seemed in good spirits, as was her right—_we owe you a great deal, Ambassador_—but Zemena could not warm to the woman. She looked more closely at Firix, and saw the strain of some concealed excitement.

Zemena summoned her _imtir_, letting the mnemonics form all around her. She delegated conversation to a light social persona within her mind, and put her _imtir_ to the task of studying Firix.

Slowly, under the cover of that modest social chatter, Zemena integrated observations: minute details of face and voice and posture, word choice, conversational flow. As she did so she became more alarmed. The strain she had seen in Firix was a strongly controlled suspense—something had not _yet_ happened, Zemena realized. She began to delve into that. In brief exasperation, she realized that if only Firix were Humano, she could Sing into the Ambassador&#8217;s _imtir_.

It was a briefly chilling thought: _Have we so specialized ourselves that we are at a disadvantage when dealing with a formidable_ imtir_-blind individual?_

Her concentration was almost broken as Patru and Alesa walked up the steps as well. _I do not need you here_, she thought; and then, _or do I?_ She nodded with her surface personality, and spoke with them comfortably, letting Firix to engage Patru in conversation.

Her true mind, seeing and hearing through the _imtir_, was becoming more unsettled. Suddenly from her _sconsciende_ a brief flash of insight emerged:

The secretary.

Firix, an ambassador with years of training in concealment and schooling appearances and verbal misdirection, was an unusually difficult problem. But Gonsevero?

Watching the small man, she felt a recurrence of alarm. He was outwardly moderate and self-effacing—so much so that she had unconsciously discounted him. But something&#8230; something&#8230;

Then the Breedmistress knew, as she watched a vague and filmy ghost begin to coalesce behind him. It was a breeding-ghost, taking its shape from his features, his motions, his conformation. Sor Gonsevero, an official of the Furnace, was of slavestock, of a line she knew: Carmanu out of Boyane, that distinctive movement of the head and shoulder as he hunched slightly in the wind. It had bred true, in the shortened generations of slaves.

The little man was deadly, of a deadly heritage.

Zemena made a brief signal to Alesa, a hand motion and a cut of eye. Then she allowed her speech to slow and stop, in such a way that all eyes were gathered to her. She slowly stiffened, and turned her back on the Furnace officials, taking two deliberate steps, opening a distance between them under cover of dramatics. Then she turned back, looking at Firix with an unfriendly eye, her attention seemingly abandoning the secretary.

&#8220;Ambassador Firix,&#8221; she said evenly. &#8220;Are you aware that your secretary is Hound slavestock, probably from Cass Rumoro?&#8221; Firix blinked.

In a moment several things happened. Gonsevero, taken off guard for only a moment, gathered himself and plunged towards her with silent speed. She backed another step, feeling painfully slow, and slower.

It was her _imtir_, saving her life by shifting her awareness into the battle mode that made time pass slowly: the great advantage of Humano fighters. She moved far less quickly than the small man, but her actions were so precise that her movements were shorter and smaller.

The thin blade that had appeared in Gonsevero&#8217;s hand slid in, not reaching her, and then back in a stroke to open the muscles of her forearm; but her arm was already moving out of the path of the backstroke. The ultimate Humano combat dictum: _Do not be there when the blow lands._

It was the only opening he was to have. Alesa, in a low flat dive of breathtaking beauty and skill, glided like a swimmer between them, slicing with the flat of her hand to strike the knife up and away. The dagger in her other hand was already darting at his thigh, and he barely evaded in time. Alesa curled and rolled, up before Gonsevero could take advantage.

Zemena continued to back away, seeing Patru step forward to grapple Firix by the arm. The Ambassador was drawing a pistol from under a fold of her beautiful robe, but he quickly twisted the hand so that she dropped it.

Firix accounted for, the fight was suddenly a single combat between the Furnace assassin and the Merides assassin. Zemena floated to a stop and watched their remarkable flickering dance with the appreciative eye of a Breedmistress.


By the time Alesa, bleeding from two lesser wounds, had relieved her antagonist of yet another hidden knife, and left him lying with a broken neck, Zemena&#8217;s timesense had resynchronized with normal life. Firix stood calmly, neither resisting Patru&#8217;s gently immobilizing hold nor kicking up any sort of quarrel or protestation.

There was a moment of stillness—and then there was a Merideza officer, Ema, running towards the watchpost with a field radio to her ear.

Zemena took the radio and spoke into it. The voice at the other end was Sor Won.

The conversation was brief.

Zemena looked up. &#8220;Patru, kindly bring your prisoner.&#8221; Then, &#8220;Alesa: we will be speaking privately. See that none disturbs us.&#8221; She handed the radio back to Ema and strode towards the watchtower, a place where they could close the door on their conversation.


<br />
##### The Tower Room

&#8220;Speak quickly,&#8221; said Zemena. &#8220;I have not killed you yet because Corro lives, and may survive.&#8221;

&#8220;What news?&#8221; asked Firix quietly.

&#8220;Dun Heitor is dead. He tried to kill Corro, no one understands why. Corro killed him instead. A pity,&#8221; she said austerely. &#8220;I rather liked Heitor, you know. Then Sor Siscozo&#8221;—she spoke the name with an extra hiss—&#8220;put an arrow into Corro&#8217;s back and ran, with his escort, ducking into the rough country.&#8221;

Zemena heard her own words as if through a muffling layer of cloth. Shock. She took a moment to force it down: she could command her body at need, even if her mind was unruly. The world was suddenly a bit warmer and crisper.

&#8220;Wan made a swift choice and a good one. He withdrew with Corro, the soldiers and Hounds providing cover. We are sending a party with Doctor Garseyo to meet them. If you live, it will be because Garseyo is a tough old battlefield bitch who knows her work.&#8221;

Firix nodded as if it were of no consequence.

&#8220;And so.&#8221; Zemena drew a breath. &#8220;Your mission is in tatters. You seem to have harbored treachery from the beginning. What was in your head? Did you wish to ruin everything?&#8221;

Patru looked at the two women with dawning recognition. &#8220;It was Siscozo, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he said.

Zemena looked at him suddenly, puzzled.

&#8220;Last night,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When we all walked. That Humano battle Song. I&#8217;ve only just realized that it was Siscozo&#8217;s voice.&#8221;

&#8220;Whatever are you talking about?&#8221;

&#8220;Did you not hear it? Distant. Unpleasant. A sort of nasal chant of a song. I couldn&#8217;t understand the words, but then, when you Humanos Sing I can seldom pick any words out anyway. It was Siscozo, surely you remember it? I thought someone was duelling somewhere.&#8221;

&#8220;No,&#8221; said Zemena. &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ve just realized that, every time that damned Song was crying, Heitor grew fierce and quarrelsome. And when it was silent, he seemed to forget his anger.&#8221; He frowned in sorrow. &#8220;Can Singing really do that? To such a formidable man?&#8221;

&#8220;Oh yes, it can indeed.&#8221; Zemena&#8217;s face grew cold and rigid with fury.

She turned to Firix. &#8220;Well, now you are trebly guilty. Not only did you seemingly arrange a murderous attack that has lost Tonor&oacute;n its Dun, and may do the same for Cass Merides -&#8221; her voice broke off thinly for a moment, then she resumed. &#8220;Not only did you deliberately destroy the accord you worked so hard to put into place.&#8221; Her dark eyes looked flatly at Firix with the emotion blown out of them like a snuffed candle flame. &#8220;You also meddled with the forbidden arts&#8230; did you have _any_ idea what you were doing?

&#8220;You see, Patru, Singing casts thoughts into the _imtir_ of the opponent. Or, not even an opponent: it has other uses, but we Humanos are a contentious people. But there are several uses that are proscribed, and every Humano&#8217;s hand is raised against the practitioner. Among these arts, there is none worse than the Silence. That is a Song whose first action is to blot out any knowledge that there is Singing occurring. Apparently Siscozo is adept at this. It&#8217;s a despicable act, much like shooting someone in the back—which, come to think of it, Siscozo has also shown himself to be skilled at doing.&#8221; A strange bitter expression crossed her face. &#8220;How long, I wonder, did Siscozo spend his time making Heitor into a beast who would kill on command? Something less than a Hound...&#8221; She turned back to Firix.

&#8220;I ask you again, Ambassador. Do you have any account of your actions? Satisfying my curiosity could make much difference in whether I kill you—or at least in what manner.&#8221;

Firix was not a person of great physical courage. She looked once again into Zemena&#8217;s deathly eyes, and looked away.

&#8220;I will tell you,&#8221; she said then. &#8220;I will tell you, and I will leave you with the choice. I am finished in any event.

&#8220;It was El Excepcion, of course. They become more powerful in Furnace politics with every month that passes.&#8221; She looked straight at Zemena, and then at Patru. &#8220;I am a Successionist, of course. Perhaps even more than any of you proud Humanos.

&#8220;El Excepcion is the same old evil that pushed the Wasters, you know&#8230; I realized, some years ago, that if the Furnace is granted any victory at all in the attempt to sustain the old technologies, El Excepcion will be the beneficiary. El Excepcion will devour it all, and spit out the bones.&#8221; She hugged her arms, looking pale and cold. &#8220;I do not hate the old works, Dina Zemena. You must understand this. I find so much beauty in the power of precision engineering. I love the things made in our crucibles. But at the same time, I believe that humanity can no more reject the temptation of those old arts than humanity can reject the drive to fecundity.&#8221;

&#8220;So,&#8221; said Zemena. &#8220;You destroyed the chance of the Furnace to sustain itself over the long term. The Road will never be built now. And it was very well accomplished. But for the accident of your secretary being of a bloodline I recognized—and the second accident of his panicking—you would have returned to the Furnace with a show of dejected failure, prepared to work further to subvert the Exceptionists. You conspired with Siscozo, and once his action had accomplished your purpose, it&#8217;s likely the Furnace would never have known.&#8221;

Zemena paced back and forth several times. Firix began to shiver, then uncontrollably to quake. But she spoke no plea.

&#8220;Patru, I brought you here because my _sconsciende_ demanded it. And now I know why. I wish a witness to my decision, a witness not of Cass Merides.

&#8220;Firix, Ambassador of the Furnace. You owe Cass Merides a debt of honor. If my son dies, you will owe me a debt of blood. For either of these I could kill you quickly&#8230; or very, very slowly.&#8221; She faced the trembling woman, dark eyes boring into eyes of green. &#8220;But I choose neither of these things.

&#8220;You are now my creature. I hold a secret that will have you destroyed by your own people, your own Council, at my whim. You will never be able to take that away from me. And girl, if you ever find yourself for a moment tempted to think that you are anything like a match for me, now that I know your mind, you are welcome to take whatever measures you choose.&#8221;

&#8220;You don&#8217;t intend kill, to kill me?&#8221; stammered the Ambassador.

&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I just say that? I&#8217;m going to send you on your way, with the thanks of Cass Merides for attempting to put matters right. And you may go back to your life, and you may _not_ resign your position in order to ride skitterers over the desert in the moonlight. I hope you will continue to bedevil El Excepcion as much as you care to; I can assure you that I despise those people at least as much as you do.

&#8220;But if I ever contact you with a request. If I ever ask you a question.&#8221; She leaned forward, and her dark eyes that had been dead and dull now glowed like obsidian in the sun. &#8220;You. Will. Satisfy the request. Find me the answer. And this debt shall last as long as your life.&#8221;

<br />

Later, Zemena and Patru sat at an outdoor table overlooking the eastern gardenlands, and the long bleak kilometers beyond. They drank wine, and waited for the return of Dun Corro. Alive or dead.

&#8220;Theatrical,&#8221; said Patru.

Zemena snorted. &#8220;Theater that will add a pleasant intelligence capability to Cass Merides.&#8221;

&#8220;What will you do about Siscozo?&#8221;

She smiled. &#8220;Siscozo&#8230; What do you think I will do?&#8221;

He shook his head. &#8220;I think you will let him believe that his use of the Silence is still a hidden thing.&#8221; He looked out to the North for a moment, north where Tonor&oacute;n lay. Tonor&oacute;n, where Siscozo would now assume his tenure as Dun. &#8220;You may even let him believe it for a good while.&#8221;

Zemena smiled again, with grim approval.

They looked out eastward over the tumbled dropping hills, and they looked with very different sight. 

Patru studied the path of descent where the Borax Road would have gone, imagining the amazing machines that would have crawled down it. In his mind&#8217;s eye he watched them, images of things that would never travel down the great Road that would never be built: heavy dull metal beasts of uncertain shape, steel and bronze and canvas and glass, lumbering remorselessly on great wheels, down past precipices and gorges, down switchbacks and over great trestle bridges of bamboo and iron, down to the streaked twisting flats in which the engineers and voyagers of the Furnace would have wrestled against fate and loss and destiny.

Zemena looked down through the eyes of her _imtir_, and she saw longed-for shapes of men and women, of Wan and Doctor Garseyo and the other Meridezas, and Corro, still alive, _Manolito&apos;s Eyes, let him still be alive_, returning up the trail. But they would not stabilize in her sight, and remained flickering ghosts. Her _imtir_ did not believe. Her _imtir_ enforced its own steel patience upon her heart.

Out on the pale flatland of the Calicar Barran&#8217;, out on the eastern desert, the rising Hell Wind hurled smoking gouts of sand and dust, dark and brown as cats in the noonday sun, crawling to the south.
