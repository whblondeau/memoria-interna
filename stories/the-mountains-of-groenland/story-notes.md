### Notes on "The Mountains of Groenland"

Story opens April 22, 2560 Gregorian.

Virtual location of Hrafney's mental exercise is a mountain peak north of Tasiusaq, Kujalleq (60° 11′ 35″ N, 44° 49′ 11″ W); I believe it to be Napasorsuaq, 60° 22′ 0″ N, 44° 46′ 0″ W, an indicated north a little over 3 miles.

Icelandic navigational charts were rewritten to use the Prime Meridian at the observatory in the mountains near reykjavik. Although it's up in the mountains, it's called the "Thingvellir Observatory". Thingvellir itself is at 64° 15′ 29″ N, 21° 7′ 30″ W. The observatory is up in the mountains to the northeast. The "Thing Meridian" is, in contemporary lat/long, 64° 22′ 7″ N, 20° 55′ 30″ W.

Therefore, to convert contemporary longitude to Icelandic longitude, apply an offset of 20° 55′ 30″.


Reykjavik: 64° 8′ 0″ N, 21° 56′ 0″ W
