# The Mountains Of Groenland

	Hrafney stood on a rough hogback ridge, the peak of XXXX, 67XX meters. Icy wind howled past her, but didn't buffet her. The rock felt rough and cold under her bare feet. Scant meters away it dropped into black gulfs of shadow. The wind pulled her towards the brink, but she balanced herself with equanimity. Hrafney had a mild smile that struck onlookers as somehow terribly generous; she smiled that smile into the wind, her hair whipping back.

The moon orbited, a wise scarred half-pearl, in the south. She could see it moving, traversing xx seconds of arc per minute of clock time. She summoned a fragment of its orbital path, a middling-blue line etched before and after in the sky, fading out with distance. The path would not occlude any star in her mental almanac, so she pulled her sextant out of its case and deftly shot the direct lunar angle against Antares, then the elevation of Antares and the moon. She began the count of seconds while working the spherical trigonometry problem from scratch. In twelve seconds she had her answer, and she knew that it was 02:37:17 in Reyk Meridian Time. 

The ecliptic arched low in the south, a hair-fine band of burning gold traced on the celestial sphere. She half-turned and gestured, and the Earth's vector of rotation lifted over the horizon, a needle of bronze rooted in the empty waters of the Pole.

Knowing the time, she was able to lay the meridians of longitude on the dark face of the world laid out below. She pondered them slightly and made their color a faint silver. With her sextant, still counting the seconds in her head, she shot lines of position on Altair and Capella, lines that crossed well. Another pair of lines from Mizar and Betelgeuse; she scored brief spiderwebs of green where the latitudes of each lay, and it was child's play to interpolate to 60 North. Then the parallels fell to either side, climbing up the curve of the Earth towards the pole, and down to the equator. The graticule was complete. The wind buffeted her and tugged at her, whipping her unbound hair to the side. She stowed her sextant and stood on tiptoe, arms out, spurning the dark plunges to rock on either side.

Pure tranquil exaltation. Hrafney had done, in 74 seconds, what whould have taken an unassisted navigator a good half hour of careful plotting and dead reckoning, of paging through almanacs and consulting the chronometer.

She'd learned how to do the basic navigation at a very young age, and been taught the powerful mnemonics of the trigonometric tables in the secret schools of the Icelandic Commonwealth. She had climbed and surveyed the mountains in person, clad in bulky fur and oiled leather, to learn their shapes and frame them in her mind: the great windswept spaces of her _innominni_, her inward memory, where she could exercise the powers of her thought, and retreat from the mundane realities of the physical world.


But the immense starscape above the mountains was showing signs of wavering and blowing, troubled by the wind. She had, in an odd combination of bravado and ascetic purity, walked naked into the icy mountaintop gales; but it was coming undone. Her true physical form was battered and starved; and the expenditure of energy of the great mental undertaking was not something her physiology could long endure.

The starscape shivered in the wind again. She lifted a last look - _this may be the last time I stand here_, she thought - and it seemed her face could fall up into the starry sky. She slowly pivoted, saving every last detail of her memory of the mountains of Groenland.

Behind her on the ridge there stood a shadowed figure, in a hooded cloak. A deep frozen terror and exaltation seized her. "Allmother," she whispered. And she wept with the gladness, that a goddess had stepped into her _innominni_. "Skysister".

The figure answered no word, but slowly pulled her hood back. A mane of wolf-gray hair streaked out on the wind. Even in the windy star-dark, her face showed clearly, strong, seamed, scarred. Her eye was like a star itself, gleaming. There was no mercy in it. Her other eye, like her Brother's, was patched.

From beneath her shadowy robe the Goddess drew a wellmade case of wood and brass, and offered it to Hrafney. Hrafney, trembling and not understanding, took it; but the goddess kept her hand extended. Hrafney suddenly knew. She slowly drew her own sextant case from its place near her skin, and humbly extended it. The Goddess smiled the faintest of smiles, and that smile shook Hrafney to the core. Then she took Hrafney's sextant, the magnificent instrument of the mind, years in the visualizing, and stowed it away. Hrafney knew that she would never see it again.

Hrafney suddenly felt the wind, like a blow to the breastbone. She almost lost her balance, and there was no place to step. A deadly weakness came over her. The last thing she saw of the Mountains of Groenland was a handful of stars blowing in the deep night, tumbling like sparks past Mount _ to the north. The lines of the celestial sphere flashed and dimmed.


Hrafney gasped and flailed, suddenly feeling warm, feeling a slow uneasy side-to-side motion. She was lying on dirty sacking, thirsty, hungry, the ache of her injuries still harsh. A dark iron manacle circled her right ankle, cutting painfully into the flesh. From it, a heavy chain ran to a staple in the bulkhead. The stench of her shitbucket overlay the shipboard smells of tar and pitch and bilge and unwashed humans. She lay quietly, wincing, listening, judging the motion of the ship. It was the slow listless swing of a vessel becalmed. There was a low thud and clack from above, confirming the fact: the boom jerking with the roll of the ship.
