# The Mountains Of Gr&#x00F8;nland

Hrafney stood on a rough hogback ridge: a thin, tall blade of rock. A sharp tooth of the world, towering in the magnificent night. Icy wind howled past her, but didn't buffet her. The rock felt rough and cold under her bare feet. Scant meters away it dropped into black gulfs of shadow. The wind pulled her towards the brink, but she balanced herself with equanimity.

Stars lifted like sparks and clouds in the crystalline sky on either hand. Icy wind howled past, but didn't discomfit her. The rock felt rough and cold under her bare feet. Scant meters away it dropped into black gulfs of shadow to right and left: the lands or seas or icefields below were unseen, because she didn't yet know where she was. The wind pulled her towards the brink, but she balanced herself with equanimity. Hrafney had a mild generous smile; she smiled that one into the wind, her hair whipping back in the night.

She half-turned and saw the North Star. She pulled her sextant out of its fur-covered case, shot the North Star's altitude, which was of course also her latitude. 60° 22′ 0″: she was down somewhere near Gr&#x00F8;nland's southern tip, and she recognized the mountain—she knew all of the mountains of Gr&#x00F8;nland, their shapes and locations—but it would be a bit of a cheat to name it just yet. Hrafney gestured to the north, and the Earth's vector of rotation lifted over the horizon, far over the horizon, a needle of dim bronze rooted in the empty waters of the Pole, 2318 nm (and thirty-odd yards) away. Of course, she also knew the ecliptic; it arched middling low in the south, a hair-fine band of burning gold traced on the celestial sphere. 

The moon also orbited in the south, a wise scarred slice of pearl just four days before full dark. Hrafney could see it moving, traversing... call it 25 seconds of arc per minute of clock time: further and slower than usual, with the lunar apogee only three days away. She summoned a fragment of its orbital path, a middling-blue line etched before and after in the sky, fading out with distance. The path would not occlude any star in her mental almanac, so with the sextant she deftly shot the direct lunar distance against reddish Aldebaran, then the elevations of Aldebaran and the moon itself. She began the count of seconds while working the spherical trigonometry problem from scratch. In twelve seconds she had her answer: she knew that it was 02:37:17 in Thing Meridian Time. 

Knowing the time, still counting the seconds in her head, she used the sextant to shoot elevations on Altair and Capella. Another elevation from Betelgeuse. She worked the lines of position from the tabular data in her mnemonic almanac.

She lifted her point of view a good thousand meters into the sky, looking down on her position as if it were a chart. She visualized the fix as brief spiderwebs in glowing green on the reference surface that touched the peak on which she stood. The fix was decent: the green lines crossed closely, and she laid her known latitude on as a fourth line.
 
And there she had her position. She was at 60° 22′ 0″ N, 23° 51′ 30″ W, and the mountain upon which she stood was Napasorsuaq, of course. An old friend.

She returned her view to her body's eyes. Knowing her position, she was able to lay meridians of longitude on the surface of altitude at her feet (the peak of Napasorsuaq was 1580 meters, so the lines of position glowed upon that surface as on a flat glass floor); and then the parallels of latitude fell north and south, climbing up the curve of the Earth towards the pole, and down to the equator. The graticule was complete, glimmering a faint silver in the darkness. Then the complicated coastline and the forms of land emerged from the darkness below her, drawn from the eternal charts in her mind.

The wind buffeted her and tugged at her, whipping her unbound hair to the side. She stowed her sextant and stood on tiptoe, arms out, spurning the dark plunges to rock on either side.

Pure tranquil exaltation. Hrafney had done, in her mind, in 134 seconds, what would have taken an unassisted navigator a good half hour of careful plotting and dead reckoning, of paging through almanacs and consulting the chronometer, of erasing and marking charts wth pencils, measuring distances with dividers.

She'd learned how to do the basic navigation at a very young age, and been taught the powerful mnemonics of the trigonometric tables in the secret schools of the Icelandic Commonwealth. She had climbed and surveyed the mountains in person, clad in bulky fur and oiled leather, to learn their shapes and frame them in her mind: the great windswept spaces of her _innrihugur_, her inward memory, where she could exercise the powers of her thought and visualization, and retreat from the dreadful realities of the physical world. _I am still myself,_ she thought with a fierce defiance. _Hrafney Framleiðandisdottir, Imperial Icelandic Hydrographer. The best navigator in the entire South China Sea._

But the immense starscape above the mountains was showing signs of wavering and blowing, troubled by the wind. She had, in an odd combination of bravado and ascetic purity, visualized herself as naked in the icy mountaintop gales; but it was coming undone. Her true physical form was battered and starved; and the expenditure of energy of the great mental undertaking was not something her physiology could long endure.

The starscape shivered in the wind again. She lifted a last look—_this may be the last time I stand here_, she thought—and it seemed her face could fall up into the starry sky. _I wish it would. I would fall free._ She slowly pivoted, saving every last detail of her memory of the mountains of Gr&#x00F8;nland.

Behind her on the ridge there stood a shadowed figure, in a hooded cloak. A deep frozen terror and exaltation seized Hrafney.

The figure slowly pulled its hood back. A mane of wolf-gray hair streaked out on the wind. Even in the shadowed star-dark, the face showed clearly, strong, seamed, scarred. An old woman. Her eye was like a star itself, gleaming. There was no mercy in it. Her other eye, like her Brother's, was patched.  "Allmother," Hrafney whispered. And she wept with the gladness, that a Goddess had stepped into her _innrihugur_. "Skysister".

The Goddess answered no word. From beneath her shadowy wind-riffled robe she drew a wellmade case of wood and brass, and offered it to Hrafney. Hrafney, trembling and not understanding, took it; but the goddess kept her hand extended. Hrafney suddenly knew. She slowly drew her own sextant case from its place near her skin, and humbly extended it. The Goddess smiled the faintest of smiles, and that smile shook Hrafney to the core. Then she took Hrafney's sextant, the magnificent instrument of the mind, years in the visualizing, and stowed it away. Hrafney knew that she would never see it again.

Hrafney suddenly felt the wind, like a blow to the breastbone. She almost lost her balance, and there was no place to step. A deadly weakness came over her. The last thing she saw of the Mountains of Gr&#x00F8;nland was a handful of stars blowing in the deep night, tumbling like sparks to the north. The lines of the celestial sphere flashed and dimmed.

<br />

Hrafney gasped and flailed, suddenly feeling warm. Warm and sticky. Warm and sticky and miserable.

She was lying on scratchy, dirty sacking in the darkness, feeling a slow uneasy side-to-side motion. She was thirsty, hungry, the ache of her injuries still harsh. The stench of her shitbucket overlay the shipboard smells of tar and pitch and bilge and smoke and unwashed humans. She lay quietly, wincing, listening, judging the motion of the ship. It was the slow listless swing of a vessel becalmed. There was a low thud and clack from above, confirming the fact: the boom was jerking idly with the roll of the ship. The _Elang Laut_ was idly floating, not sailing.

_Well,_ she thought, _perhaps I will not die today._

Dim light leaked in through the open sidescuttle. Painfully Hrafney hauled herself to her feet. She was able to reach the scuttle, but only just: a heavy iron manacle circled her right ankle, cutting painfully into the flesh. From it, a heavy chain ran to a staple in the bulkhead. Still, she could put her face to the port and see out.

The air from outside was scant relief, moist and dead, but less laden with ship smells. The warm muggy weather of the South China Sea had gone to mist, which was sluggishly clearing. Dim shapes of towering clouds were slowly revealed to view as the weak colorless morning light strengthened. The water was the same slow oily swing of old spent swells, untroubled by the slightest breeze. Gray as lead, gray as grease. It was hard to judge the ship's head, but she thought the bow might be pointing southeast. Her scuttle was on the ship's starboard side.

Always Hrafney had disliked dead days becalmed, enduring them with a caged impatience and exasperation. Dead air and dead water; trash thrown overboard still floating alongside two days later unless there were sharks. Feeling a film on the skin that would not go away even with scrubbing—even if you were fool enough to draw up a washbucket of the fouled water that gathered around the hull. But this morning, leaning her aching body against the inside of the hull, everything about the sullen weather seemed beyond praise.

Behind her the hatch to the improvised brig was unbarred and swung back. It was her keeper, the Blue Woman, Kianshing, a dim slender shape in scanty rags. She gave Hrafney a murmured greeting, not meeting her eyes. 

"Day's greeting, Kianshing." The sailors of the Northern Pacific spoke the Paritid dialect, compounded of Nihono, Hespen, Siberian, and tag ends of other languages, even some Icelandic. Hrafney spoke it pretty well—better than Kianshing, who had come aboard from some harbor in Kamchaka. The Blue Woman came closer. She was, in her way, an attractive person and not unintelligent; which, Hrafney thought distantly, probably weren't great advantages for a whore and a cook's helper. But Kianshing seemed especially diminished in the weak light.

The Blue Woman grimaced when she saw the nearly-full shitbucket. She was not obligated to dump it, but she had seen the mess when Hrafney, with her injured arm, had first tried to empty it through the sidescuttle. Thereafter she had always just dealt with it, taking it up on deck to throw over the side. Kianshing was not without kindness, which made her better, in Hrafney's eyes, than many of the sailors. Even the Paritids were often cruel and heedless, but the Musis and Shakorta that had made up an increasing proportion of the crew as the _Elang Laut_ had coasted south were harsh to women as a matter of custom—of ideology, really. "You are good to me when you do not have to be," Hrafney said quietly. "Thank you for that." She had never known how Kianshing might take even a well-meant remark: Blue Women were usually distracted and a bit befuddled by the variant cannabis they smoked—the drug that stained their skins with wandering marks like faded old tattoos—but there was something more about Kianshing. Maybe she was just a timid soul—_although why under Sky would a timid person go to sea?_, she thought—but she suspected that many of the sailors mistreated her.

Kianshing raised her eyes, looked up into Hrafney's battered face. "I am sorry," she said. "...I have lived on or by the sea for my entire life. I think... the wind will come up soon. Not today, perhaps. But soon." She bowed her head unhappily. "I am sorry," she said again. Then she stepped out of the brig, a small slim figure carrying a bucket of piss and shit with caution and wearily accustomed repugnance. At the hatchway she turned for a moment. 

"I am glad you killed them," she said.

Captain Natan scowled at the Musi sailors. They were a rough lot, three of them, with wiry corded muscles and harsh sun-darkened faces. Their heavy black hair was tarred back into tails in the immemorial fashion of sailors. They stood in attitudes of insolence, and Natan knew that it was a hairsbreadth away from menace, then inevitably violence. Inwardly he cursed the need for these damned southerners. Too many of his Paritids had left as the _Elang Laut_ had made passage down into the almost unendurably hot latitudes. The Musi and Shakorta were handy sailors, but he felt increasingly that he couldn't trust them, didn't know them. And now they were confronting his authority, with the crew watching. Becalmed, which made matters all the worse.

"We cannot wait while you waste time," the foremost said. "The Musi begin to think that you have no thought of executing her. We begin to think that you wish to find a _hadiyat_, a... pretext, for not killing her at all."

"Your grasp of the Paritid tongue is praiseworthy," Natan said, meaning it; for he was a fair man. "But you perhaps have not understood what I have told you." No one who had not sailed with the burly captain would have interpreted the deceptive bleak mildness of his voice rightly. Some of the Paritid crew idled closer, expecting a brawl. The Paritids were a mixed breed. Many showed the classic Nihono features and bearing: Laska and Polar people, with black hair and eyes, skins burnt to a dark gold under the heavy sun of the tropics. Others were bigger folk with paler skin and brown or even red hair, from Sentl or the Roslands. A few strange ones: Tiza, the Humano from the mountains far inland; Eccaron, black-skinned with curled black hair, from the plantations of Friscu; Edwulf the Icelander.
