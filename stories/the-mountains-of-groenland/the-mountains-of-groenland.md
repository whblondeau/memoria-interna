# The Mountains Of Groenland

Hrafney stood on a rough hogback ridge, a sharp tooth of the world in the magnificent night. Stars lifted like sparks and clouds in the crystalline sky. Icy wind howled past her, but didn't buffet her. The rock felt rough and cold under her bare feet. Scant meters away it dropped into black gulfs of shadow to right and left: the lands or seas or icefields below were unseen, because she didn't yet know where she was. The wind pulled her towards the brink, but she balanced herself with equanimity. Hrafney had a mild smile that struck onlookers as somehow terribly generous; she smiled that one into the wind, her hair whipping back in the night.

She half-turned and saw the North Star. She pulled her sextant out of its fur-covered case, shot the North Star's altitude, which was of course also her latitude. 60° 22′ 0″: she was down somewhere near Groenland's southern tip, and she recognized the mountain—she knew all of the mountains of Groenland, their shapes and locations—but it would be a bit of a cheat to name it just yet. Hrafney gestured to the north, and the Earth's vector of rotation lifted over the horizon, far over the horizon, a needle of dim bronze rooted in the empty waters of the Pole, 2318 nm (and thirty-odd yards) away. Of course, she also knew the ecliptic; it arched middling low in the south, a hair-fine band of burning gold traced on the celestial sphere. 

The moon orbited in the south, a wise scarred slice of pearl just four days before full dark. Hrafney could see it moving, traversing... call it 25 seconds of arc per minute of clock time: further and slower than usual, with the lunar apogee only three days away. She summoned a fragment of its orbital path, a middling-blue line etched before and after in the sky, fading out with distance. The path would not occlude any star in her mental almanac, so and deftly shot the direct lunar distance against reddish Aldebaran, then the elevations of Aldebaran and the moon itself. She began the count of seconds while working the spherical trigonometry problem from scratch. In twelve seconds she had her answer, and she knew that it was 02:37:17 in Thing Meridian Time. 

Knowing the time, still counting the seconds in her head, she used the sextant to shoot elevations on Altair and Capella. Another elevation from Betelgeuse. She worked the lines from the tabular data in her mnemonic almanac.
She lifted her point of view a good thousand meters into the sky, looking down on her position as if it were a chart. 

She visualized the fix as brief spiderwebs in glowing green on the reference surface that touched the peak on which she stood. The fix was decent: the green lines crossed closely, and she laid her known latitude on as a fourth line.
 
And there she had her position. She was at 60° 22′ 0″ N, 23° 51′ 30″ W, and the mountain upon which she stood was Napasorsuaq, of course. An old friend.

She returned her visualization to her body's presence. Knowing her position, she was able to lay meridians of longitude on the surface at her feet; and then the parallels of latitude fell north and south, climbing up the curve of the Earth towards the pole, and down to the equator. The graticule was complete, glimmering a faint silver in the darkness. Then the complicated coastline and the forms of land emerged from the darkness below her, drawn from the eternal charts in her mind.

The wind buffeted her and tugged at her, whipping her unbound hair to the side. She stowed her sextant and stood on tiptoe, arms out, spurning the dark plunges to rock on either side.

Pure tranquil exaltation. Hrafney had done, in 74 seconds, what whould have taken an unassisted navigator a good half hour of careful plotting and dead reckoning, of paging through almanacs and consulting the chronometer.

She'd learned how to do the basic navigation at a very young age, and been taught the powerful mnemonics of the trigonometric tables in the secret schools of the Icelandic Commonwealth. She had climbed and surveyed the mountains in person, clad in bulky fur and oiled leather, to learn their shapes and frame them in her mind: the great windswept spaces of her _innrihugur_, her inward memory, where she could exercise the powers of her thought and visualization, and retreat from the dreadful realities of the physical world. _I am still myself,_ she thought with a fierce defiance. _Hrafney Framleiðandisdottir, Imperial Icelandic Hydrographer. The best navigator in the entire South China Sea._

But the immense starscape above the mountains was showing signs of wavering and blowing, troubled by the wind. She had, in an odd combination of bravado and ascetic purity, walked naked into the icy mountaintop gales; but it was coming undone. Her true physical form was battered and starved; and the expenditure of energy of the great mental undertaking was not something her physiology could long endure.

The starscape shivered in the wind again. She lifted a last look - _this may be the last time I stand here_, she thought - and it seemed her face could fall up into the starry sky. She slowly pivoted, saving every last detail of her memory of the mountains of Groenland.

Behind her on the ridge there stood a shadowed figure, in a hooded cloak. A deep frozen terror and exaltation seized her. "Allmother," she whispered. And she wept with the gladness, that a goddess had stepped into her _innominni_. "Skysister".

The figure answered no word, but slowly pulled her hood back. A mane of wolf-gray hair streaked out on the wind. Even in the shadowed star-dark, her face showed clearly, strong, seamed, scarred. Her eye was like a star itself, gleaming. There was no mercy in it. Her other eye, like her Brother's, was patched.

From beneath her shadowy robe the Goddess drew a wellmade case of wood and brass, and offered it to Hrafney. Hrafney, trembling and not understanding, took it; but the goddess kept her hand extended. Hrafney suddenly knew. She slowly drew her own sextant case from its place near her skin, and humbly extended it. The Goddess smiled the faintest of smiles, and that smile shook Hrafney to the core. Then she took Hrafney's sextant, the magnificent instrument of the mind, years in the visualizing, and stowed it away. Hrafney knew that she would never see it again.

Hrafney suddenly felt the wind, like a blow to the breastbone. She almost lost her balance, and there was no place to step. A deadly weakness came over her. The last thing she saw of the Mountains of Groenland was a handful of stars blowing in the deep night, tumbling like sparks past Mount _ to the north. The lines of the celestial sphere flashed and dimmed.


Hrafney gasped and flailed, lying on dirty sacking in the darkness, suddenly feeling warm, feeling a slow uneasy side-to-side motion. She was thirsty, hungry, the ache of her injuries still harsh. The stench of her shitbucket overlay the shipboard smells of tar and pitch and bilge and unwashed humans. She lay quietly, wincing, listening, judging the motion of the ship. It was the slow listless swing of a vessel becalmed. There was a low thud and clack from above, confirming the fact: the boom was jerking idly with the roll of the ship.

_Well,_ she thought, _perhaps I will not die today._

A heavy iron manacle circled her right ankle, cutting painfully into the flesh. From it, a heavy chain ran to a staple in the bulkhead.
