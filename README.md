### Memoria Interna: Tales of the Circumpolar

_Note: all dates are here given according to the Gregorian Calendar, extended proleptically forward without regard to changes in calendrical or cultural conventions in the imagined future history._

This project is by intention a group of related stories set in the North American continent and the regions around the Polar (Arctic) Ocean _ca._ 2560, following a fairly complete collapse of the global industrial civilization that flourished from the 19th to the 21st centuries - and the concomitant climate changes, mass migrations, and collapse of human and other ecological communities.

#### Technologies of mind
The story cycle gets its name from the old Spanish term for "Internal Memory", a reference to schools of superior development of the human mental and sensory faculties. Humans, denied the degree of material technology available to high-energy cultures, have turned their attention to the rediscovery of the old [Arts of Memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_of_memory) and related mental disciplines.

The stories, as developed, will be in the [/stories](./stories) subdirectory of this repository.
