### Memoria Interna: Tales of the Circumpolar

_Note: all dates are here given according to the Gregorian Calendar, extended proleptically forward without regard to changes in calendrical or cultural conventions in the imagined future history._

This project is by intention a group of related stories set in the North American continent and the regions around the Polar (Arctic) Ocean _ca._ 2560, following a fairly complete collapse of the global industrial civilization that flourished from the 19th to the 21st centuries; and the concomitant climate changes, mass migrations, and collapse of human and other ecological communities.

The stories, as developed, will be in the /stories subdirectory of this repository.

The sparse and rambling synopsis below is of course subject to change. Parts of it will be expanded in supporting documents in /background.

#### Geographical distribution of humans

##### The Circumpolar
With the equatorial regions closed to human habitation, and the former "temperate zones" grown very much intemperate, the melting of the Arctic ice has shifted the core of human civilization to the coasts of the Polar Ocean. As has always been the case with a central sea of any kind, the Polar has become the maritime crossroads of the world. 

The peoples of the Polar Ocean are generally culturally vigorous. The primary constraint on their population size is the availability of food. Permaculture has been adapted, in many ingenious ways, to the weak insolation of the arctic circle. Also, the Polar Ocean is still in many regions ecologically alive, and a limited fishing industry is possible (although it took a number of wars to impose a sustainable regimen.) Still, food is not easily found.

The Polar Ocean has a history of violent conflict, mostly triggered by contention for resources, but also by ideological conflict between Emergist thought and a number of other political organizing principles. Emergism - a stringent application of ecological and thermodynamic realities to economic and political theory - has become the politically dominant ideology in the Polar Ocean region, as well as having strong influence in the rest of the habitable northern hemisphere. 

##### North America
With climate change, the southwestern part of North America has become uninhabitable in any meaningful sense. The center of the continent is known as the Dry, because it has become extremely arid. South of the location of present-day Denver, the dry becomes the Dead Dry, in which the heat is so fierce that nobody can survive unless they have underground dwellings and a reliable source of water - aquifer recharge in this region has stopped due to lack of meaningful surface precipitation. 

The Dry abates somewhat further east, shading gradually into dry grassland and some low-lying swamps near the Mississippi River, and then tropical forest in the regions north of the Gulf of Mexico. The old South of the United States of America is inhabited sparsely by hunter-gatherer tribes. The ones further east are more like the Amazonian tribes of our current time. Further west, they become dryland tribes, analogous to present-day Australian Aborigines or Kalahari Bushmen. However, they have had only comparatively short time (centuries rather than millennia) to adapt fully to such an environment, and are correspondingly less successful. The dryland populations remain sparse and precarious.

Further south, few regions of old Mexico remain habitable. Oaxaca, due to the size of its high-altitude regions, still supports a non-primitive culture, but one that's been isolated for a long time; the Oaxacans have not sustained the level of basic electronic technology necessary for maintaining radio communication, and overland travel is prohibitively difficult.

On the eastern seaboard of North America, organized civilization tends to increase going north. Coastal habitation is much more sparse than would ordinarily have been expected, because the Atlantic ecologies are in states of collapse. Fishing for food is not a realistic option, as it was in times familiar to today's readers. The extreme heat has forced the mix of tropical forest and grassland far to the north. More settled lands are not necessarily centrally organized either politically of socially: with permaculture-style intensive gardening replacing wide-field agriculture as the primary base of the food structure, the need for large-scale organization is considerably reduced.


#### General characteristics of human communities

##### Permaculture
The most distinctive organizing principle of human communities in this time is the widespread use of permaculture as a base food resource. This has a number of profound effects.

* Permaculture allows for greater density of settlement.

* Permaculture tends to support small units of political and social organization. Intensive gardening is much less expansive than extensive field agriculture: transportation and storage of the yields is far less demanding, favoring autonomous use of gardens.

* Permaculture requires a much higher level of gardening skill, ecological literacy, general craftsmanship, and mechanical aptitude than was the rule for agricultural societies in the past. This pushes cultures in the direction of valuing education, and limits the utility of unskilled labor. Also - just as industrial civilization drove widespread literacy, mathematical ability, and general scientific knowledge - permacultural society drives a level of whole systems thinking unprecedented in human history.

* Permaculture is a long-term investment compared to other forms of agriculture. It's very difficult for a permaculture-based village to up sticks and move somewhere else; this was never easy for agricultural communities in the past, but where traditional agriculture requires a year or two of hard work to establish itself in a new location, permaculture can take decades to really take hold.


#### The Wasters
Contemporary humans refer to the people of industrial civiilization as "Wasters". Due to the disruptions of decline, accurate historical records of industrial civilization have become rare. In the absence of any real historical understanding, the Time of the Wasters has become a convenient peg on which to hang all sorts of cultural narratives, increasingly woven out of creative guesswork as the centuries pass.

One ubiquitous cultural phenomenon has been the reimagining of the Wasters as a completely corrupt and fundamentally evil apocalyptic phase in human history. The proposition is perhaps arguably correct in objective terms; beyond that, however, it has become the foundation of ethical and moral systems worldwide. All major remaining ethical and religious traditions have incorporated - with varying degrees of sophistication - severe proscriptions against Waster thought and behavior. Most of them have adopted counter-principles derived from principles of ecological economics and systems theory.

The scientific and technological achievements of the industrial civilization are increasingly forgotten. 

#### Technologies of mind
The story cycle gets its name from the old Spanish term "Internal Memory", a reference to schools of superior development of the human mental and sensory faculties. Humans, denied the degree of material technology available to high-energy cultures, have turned their attention to the rediscovery of the old Arts of Memory and related mental systems.
