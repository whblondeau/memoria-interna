### Languages spoken in Circumpolar regions

_[Disclaimer: I'm no philologist. This is nothing more than a deliberately vague and idiosyncratic account of the kinds of languages people would have developed under stress of migration, depopulation, and historical accident. So, this is likely to be somewhat volatile.]_

#### Hespen
Hespen is derived mainly from Mexican Espa&#241;ol, with a lot of English (and in the West, Japanese) loan-words. It's the primary language spoken in the habitable parts of North America. Hespen is, in turn, divided into Eastern and Western dialects by the simple geographical division imposed by the Dry, the arid and uninhabited central region of North America.
##### East Hespen
The eastern parts of the former United States of America saw, during and after the initial waves of Mexican migration, a largely seaborne influx of people from the tropical spanish-speaking regions. East Hespen is accordingly influenced by the Spanish spoken in the Carribbean, Central America, and the northeastern parts of South America. Other significant linguistic influences are French (both Carribbean and Quebecois), Brazilian Portugese, and Arabic and African languages (primarily of the Niger-Congo linguistic family) introduced during the great transatlantic migrations of 2090-2160.
##### West Hespen
The Hespen spoken in the western habitable regions of North America is linguistically simpler than Eastern Hespen. The base language is closer to the original Mexican Espa&#241;ol; the proportion of English admixtures is more stable; and the only major secondary influence is the strong admixture of Japanese from the Japanese Diaspora of the 21st century, and the contiguity of the Diaspora communities in followint centuries.

West Hespen had its origins in California and the Southwestern United States. In California, the English-speaking communities were more populous and stable, and the Diaspora got an early foothold. Further east, over the mountains and into the Great Plains, a substrain of Hespen developed from purer Espa&#241;ol. In subsequent centuries, as the center of the continent dried out, the majority of those Hespen speakers moved west and north along the Rockies, bringing a more old-fashioned Mexican cultural infusion with them.

Over time, as equatorial regions heated up, the Hespen language moved up into what had been Canada. Again, there was a geographic subdivision: the Rocky Mountains still tended to separate the more cosmopolitan peoples of the seaboard from the more tribally organized people in the receding zones of habitability between the Dry and the Rockies.


#### Siberian
Siberian is primarily Mandarin Chinese, with some Mongolian, Russian, and Indonesian admixtures.


#### Norse
Iceland, due to its developed geothermal resources, was able to build steel-hulled and steel-masted windjammers, and other legacy engineering products, for a long time. This, together with the island's maritime traditions, caused Iceland to develop a mercantile and military empire that spanned a great deal of the resource-significant regions of the Circumpolar. The Empire faded as a political entity (as they do), but continued to exert great cultural influence as an economic association similar to the Hanseatic League in the late Medieval Baltic. The Icelandic Norse language proved unexpectedly resistant to linguistic drift; and it had become firmly established as the common language of Circumpolar trade. 

So, ironically, a Norse language generally understandable by 14th century Icelandic farmers (excepting loan-words from Japanese, Arabic, Mandarin, Indonesian etc) is now spoken across the core civilization of the northern hemisphere.
