## Makers

In the aftermath of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, a great deal of classical knowledge was irretrievably lost. What was saved was saved through a very unlikely mechanism: Christian monasteries, especially those in remote areas. In the Gljúfrasteinn Collection is a 20th century American book, written by a scholar named Thomas Cahill in the English language. This book, called ["How the Irish Saved Civilization"](), describes the premier example of this process.

The monastic preservation of classical knowledge seems surprising, at least at first, because most of what the monks so patiently copied was heretical or at least theologically dangerous according to Medieval Christian thought. The monks skated around this issue by blandly stating that the work was being done "for the glory of God". This seems like an astonishingly weak reed: Christianity is a chauvinistic and often belligerent intellectual tradition. Historically, Christians have burned or suppressed far more literary works than they&apos;ve preserved.

Nonetheless, it happened. One can only speculate that a lot of the monks were genuine intellectuals in their way, and found onstensibly devout justifications for the work they did to preserve the things they loved, or at least found fascinating. We can only be grateful for this.

Yet, this was in essence sort of a "skunkworks" in American Waster idiom, a clandestine project pursuing objectives not necessarily well understood—or endorsed—by the organization as a whole. The justification was thin and resulted in a woefully unsystematic process of selection. Given the literary quality and evidentiary historical importance of what has been preserved, it&apos;s painful to speculate about the things that were lost. When a dark age is setting on, it would be nice to know that some methodical and unsuperficial thought has gone into efforts to save things that we care about preserving.

One of the conceptual gaps that Christian monasteries papered over was that they acted almost purely as conservators. They were not preserving literature or poetry akin to things that they wrote, because they didn&apos;t write anything of the kind. Their comparatively few creative efforts were limited to works of ecclesiatical celebration and instruction: rather different from Marcus Aurelius or, certainly, Sappho.

Nor did the preservationists in the monasteries consciously attempt to save scientific or technical knowledge. If they did save any such, it was as curators rather than practitioners: Roger Bacon and his ilk were rare birds in the monastic communities, and always vulnerable to charges of impiety, pride, or outright heresy. In general, the simplicity and withdrawal of monastic life - the very qualities that made it possible for monastic effors to survive the dark centuries - also precluded much practical interest in the content of the works themselves.

Accordingly, it seems fair to say that the Medieval monks and nuns wrote things down not from the perspective of scholars or even librarians, but more as technically proficient copyists exercising the basic skills of that trade: cataloging, calligraphy and reading.

What might have occurred had the monasteries been more concerned with their documents as part of a living tradition of scholarly study and material practice is hard to say. On the one hand, a lot less would probably have been lost to random chance; on the other, the careful reproduction of classic works might have suffered the normal entropy of active intellectual discussion. Furthermore, the isolation of the monasteries would inevitably been breached much more commonly if they had had more worldly benefits to offer.

All of this is to introduce the concept of the role that Maker culture played in the evolving history of the post-Waster world. This role was in many respects parallel, but there were considerable divergences.

### Post-Waster evolution of Maker traditions

The Makers, unlike the Christian monasteries of Medieval Europe, did not at first have a singular ecclesiastical perspective to support their efforts. Nor did they exist in a uniform cultural matrix. Maker culture, and its close relatives Hacker culture and Crafter culture, emerged out of the final uniformities of industrial civilization; but they were all from the beginning intensively local, and so a good deal of drift and divergence characterized them.

The common concepts of the Makers were _community_, _tools_, _creating_, and _learning_. Early makerspaces tended to gravitate to the young and the privileged (in most cultures, male.) However, there was from the beginning a dynamic of attraction for the traditionally underprivileged and excluded. Most makerspaces tended to welcome outsiders, because the Maker movement saw itself as an outsider culture. In the beginning, the Maker ethos very quickly came to see itself as being in opposition to the gigantism, specialization, and complex interdependence of Waster norms. This, as is commonly the case, fostered a strong sense of group loyalty, and in most cases apparently prepared the ground for an ideological rejection of precisely those forms of privilege that had granted the initial makerspaces their opportunities.

There is a term in surviving late Waster literature that remains the subject of scholarly debate. This term, "intersectionality" in English sources, appears to represent a philosophical tenet in resistance to structures of privilege. (There is an alternate view that "intersectionality" refers to a specific set of sexual practices in vogue in America and Mexico during the time period; for a good survey of those arguments, cf. Axelsson 2347. Despite the widespread social-sexual obsessions of the late Waster years, this writer finds the supporting scholarship unconvincing. See Olafsdottir, _Common Historical Errors in Waster Scholarship_, Hellisheiði University Press, 2349.) Intersectionality, in its more widely accepted sense of social unity between traditionally divided disadvantaged social categories, was certainly a feature of early maker culture. Most makerspaces of the first half of the 21st century seem to have engaged in deliberate welcome of various disadvantaged groups.

In later centuries, all sorts of romantic nonsense emerged about the mostly forgotten origins of the Maker movement. The truth was both more prosaic and more wonderful than the legends: the Makers inevitably provided a model for getting material things done when the supply chains of the Waster world, link by link, broke down.

In so doing, the Makers preserved skills and practices that would otherwise probably have been lost.

#### Early Makerspaces: Frail Shoots

The beginnings of makerspaces were "community spaces", nurtured by the prosperity of the failing Waster years. Even as it fell apart, Waster civilization retained standards of discretionary wealth hard for subsequent cultures to truly understand. It was not too difficult for a few enterprising individuals to cobble together a space and some donations of equipment. This was often further supported by "grants", a typically Waster standardization of generosity.

As is always the case, most such hardscrabble efforts failed. However, and crucially, the _culture_ of Making survived the failure of its individual instances. Much of the credit for Making&apos;s durability must go to the gigantism, specialization, alienation, and uniformity of Waster culture: it created an atmosphere in which simply working with one&apos;s hands, locally, using a wide range of skills and technologies, became a notable personal adventure for individuals so inclined.

It is perhaps a simple stroke of luck that this adventure became a realistic option for a wide range of underemployed individuals at precisely the time that the general social contract of Waster industrialism was being withdrawn.

Maker culture also received a significant boost as the final stages of Waster industrial technology shifted from a paradigm of mass production to one of high automation. The Corporations of the 20th century 

Consider the early, tentative transition of makerspaces from shared community resources to collective actors in the community.
